	The nine-spined stickleback Marey map with offspring haplotypes.
	Three header lines:
	1. Family ID, female-male
	2. Offspring ID
	3. Offspring sex
	Column names:
	1. Linkage group
	2. Position
	3. Linkage group number
	4. Paternal cM
	5. Maternal cM
	6. Onwards: offspring's paternal and maternal haplotypes, respectively, coded with numbers 1 and 2. 0 indicates that the haplotype is uncertain. For example, "1 1" means that the offspring's alleles are from paternal grand parent "1" and  maternal grand parent "1". The grand parent coding is arbitrary across chromosomes, i.e. paternal grand parent "1" in one chromosome may appear as grandparent "2" in another chromosome.
